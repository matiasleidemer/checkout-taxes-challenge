# Challenge Solution

This repository implements a solution for the Checkout/Tax problem.

## Dependencies

This project has only RSpec for running tests. Install it with `bundle`

## Running the examples

I left a couple of input examples (check the input#.txt files). Run them on the
terminal with:

```
ruby app.rb input1.txt
```

## Tests

Run the test with

```
bundle exec rspec
```
